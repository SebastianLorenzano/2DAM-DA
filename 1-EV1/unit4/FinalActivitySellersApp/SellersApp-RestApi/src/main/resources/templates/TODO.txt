TODO List:


0. Make all menus work (Make it work perfectly later, but make sure it doesn't break now)
1. Add Spring Security to the project
2. Restrict access to the REST API to only authenticated users
3. Complete ViewControllers with the seller they get from Security
2. Make sure the menus cannot be broken by the user doing weird things
3. Add all logic in a middle layer so both Hibernate and REST API can use it
    (Class in original project that can be used by both)


?. Make all menus unbreakable by the user
