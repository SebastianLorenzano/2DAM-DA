TODO List:


0. Make all menus work (Make it work perfectly later, but make sure it doesn't break now)
2. Make sure the menus cannot be broken by the user doing weird things



?. Add all logic in a middle layer so both Hibernate and REST API can use it
    (Class in original project that can be used by both)

?. Fix REST API so /products doesn't return remaining products only. It should be
          remaining

?. Make all controllers from base REST API use services

?. Make all menus unbreakable by the user
