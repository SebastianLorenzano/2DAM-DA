TODO List:


1. Make it so the Product SQL request takes a remaining parameter
2. Remove hidden password from seller-save.html
3. Reformat SellerWebServices so its easier to follow


?. Add all logic in a middle layer so both Hibernate and REST API can use it
    (Class in original project that can be used by both)

?. Fix REST API so /products doesn't return remaining products only. It should be
          remaining

?. Make all controllers from base REST API use the services as web controllers

?. Make database manage all logic that has to process big amounts of data
